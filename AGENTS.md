# Agent Instructions

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PEROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Note for Codex/GPT-5.2

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/main.rs, src/patterns.rs. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
